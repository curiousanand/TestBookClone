# Types Directory

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions for the TestBook Clone application.

## Structure

- `user.ts` - User-related types and interfaces
- `course.ts` - Course and content types
- `exam.ts` - Assessment and exam types
- `api.ts` - API response types
- `ui.ts` - UI component prop types
- `global.d.ts` - Global type declarations

## Guidelines

- Use interfaces over types when possible
- Export all types for reuse across the application
- Use proper naming conventions (PascalCase for types/interfaces)
- Include JSDoc comments for complex types
- Organize related types in the same file
